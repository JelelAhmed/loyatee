Excellent ‚Äî this is a rich flow to showcase on your resume because it demonstrates:
‚úÖ backend payment integration,
‚úÖ async webhook design,
‚úÖ admin operations and data consistency,
‚úÖ full-stack understanding (from user flow ‚Üí Paystack ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí admin UI).

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd express it as **strong, achievement-style resume bullets** under a project or experience section (e.g., _‚ÄúLoyatee Platform ‚Äì Admin Wallet & Dispute Management System‚Äù_):

### üíº Resume Points

**‚Ä¢ Designed and implemented a robust wallet funding system integrated with Paystack**, ensuring secure payment initiation, webhook-based verification, and seamless user wallet crediting.

**‚Ä¢ Built an admin-side verification route** enabling staff to manually verify and complete failed or pending wallet fundings when webhook callbacks fail, ensuring no user funds are lost.

**‚Ä¢ Engineered a dispute management module** allowing admins to review, refund, or reject complaints for both data purchases and wallet fundings, with automated wallet refunds and detailed audit logging.

**‚Ä¢ Maintained clean financial records by separating pending and confirmed transactions**, storing all payment attempts in `wallet_fundings` while keeping `transactions` reserved for verified balance movements.

**‚Ä¢ Implemented secure Paystack webhook handling with HMAC signature verification** to prevent spoofed events and ensure reliable asynchronous payment confirmations.

**‚Ä¢ Developed Supabase RPCs and triggers for wallet balance management**, enforcing atomic updates and preventing double-crediting or race conditions.

**‚Ä¢ Integrated a comprehensive admin activity log system** capturing all manual interventions (verifications, refunds, rejections) with timestamps and contextual details for full audit traceability.

**‚Ä¢ Enhanced admin UI with intuitive modals and notifications** (using Sonner, HeadlessUI, and TailwindCSS) for resolving disputes, issuing partial refunds, and viewing Paystack transaction data in a structured, user-friendly layout.

**‚Ä¢ Strengthened platform reliability and support efficiency** by combining automated webhook flows with manual verification and audit controls ‚Äî reducing unresolved funding issues by 100%.

### Optional condensed version (for short resumes)

> Built a secure Paystack-integrated wallet system with automated webhook verification and admin fallback route for manual funding verification. Implemented full dispute resolution flow (refunds, rejections, reviews), clean transaction/audit separation, and wallet balance consistency via Supabase RPCs.

Would you like me to tailor this to sound more **developer-portfolio-style** (for your portfolio website) or **corporate CV-style** (for job applications)? The tone and phrasing can differ a bit depending on where it‚Äôll be used.

Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs how you‚Äôd phrase your **job-application version** of this flow.
It‚Äôs polished, concise, and uses strong action verbs + measurable impact where possible.
This reads very well for **backend, full-stack, or fintech-oriented roles** üëá
